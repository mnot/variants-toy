# Variants Toy

This is a prototype implementation of the algorithms in [HTTP Representation Variants](https://mnot.github.io/I-D/variants/), and is expected to evolve with them.

Currently, it elides the header parsing, expecting the test data to contain pre-parsed header fields.

Run it like:

> python2 variants.py test.json

Regarding code quality - don't judge me.
